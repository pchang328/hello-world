Learning to use git-hub so I don't screw up again
Hi my name is Paul Chang. So what exactly does a commit do? A commit is a way for you to save changes to a particular document on github so that git knows knows that you made changes to a file. If you just saved changes in your local directory, git has no way of knowing that you made these changes. A commit records these changes in git.
